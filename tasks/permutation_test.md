### Assignment: permutation_test
#### Date: Deadline: Feb 13, 23:59
#### Points: 1 point

Given two trained models, perform a random permutation test that the second one
is better than the first one.

The template will appear soon.
Note that you usually need to perform a lot of resamplings, so you
should make sure your implementation is fast enough.
