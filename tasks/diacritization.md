### Assignment: diacritization
#### Date: Deadline: Nov 24, 23:59
#### Points: 4 points+6 bonus

The goal of the `diacritization` competition is to learn to add diacritics to
the given Czech text. We will use a small collection of
[fiction books](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl129/1920/datasets/fiction-train.txt),
which is available under [CC BY-NC-SA license](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl129/1920/datasets/fiction-train.LICENSE).
At test time, you will be given Czech texts without diacritics and you should return
them including diacritical marks – to be explicit, we only consider diacritized
letters `áčďéěíňóřšťúůýž` and their uppercase variants.

More details will appear later.
