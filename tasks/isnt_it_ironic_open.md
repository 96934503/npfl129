### Assignment: isnt_it_ironic_open
#### Date: Deadline: Jan 05, 23:59
#### Points: up to 10 bonus points

This is an extended version of `isnt_it_ironic` competition to a so-called
_open_ track. The differences against the original competition are:
- the general idea is to achieve the highest score, ideally state-of-the-art
- you can use any framework and any algorithm, including code you did not
  write yourself (but of course do not share code outside teams)
- you can use any unannotated data
- use **only** the manual annotations (i.e., labels of irony) from the training
  data, do not search for or create more
- after Dec 15, the test tweets without annotations will be distributed and you
  will submit only a text file with their annotations
