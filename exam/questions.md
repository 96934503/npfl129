- Explain how reinforcement learning differs from supervised and unsupervised
  learning in terms of experience the learning algorithms to use model
  performance. [5]

- Explain why we need separate train and test data? What is generalization and
  how the concept relates to underfitting and overfitting? [10]

- Define the prediction function of a linear regression model and write down
  $L^2$-regularized mean squared error loss. [10]

- Starting from unregularized sum of squares error of a linear regression model,
  show how the explicit solution can be obtained, assuming
  $\boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol X$ is regular. [10]
