- Define prediction function of a linear regression model and write down
  $L^2$-regularized mean squared error loss. [5]

- Starting from unregularized sum of squares error of a linear regression model,
  show how the explicit solution can be obtained, assuming
  $\boldsymbol X^T \boldsymbol X$ is regular. [10]
