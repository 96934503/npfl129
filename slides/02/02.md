# Gradient Descent

Sometimes it is more practical to search for the best model weights
in an iterative/incremental/sequential fashion. Either because there is too much
data, or the direct optimization is not feasible.

~~~
![w=53%,f=right](gradient_descent.pdf)

Assuming we are minimizing an error function
$$\argmin_→w E(→w),$$
we may use _gradient descent_:
$$→w ← →w - α∇_→wE(→w)$$

~~~
The name _stochastic gradient descent_ or _online_ gradient descent
is a variant when we iteratively update the weights one training example
at a time.

---
# Gradient Descent of Linear Regression

For linear regression and sum of squares, we can update the weights as
$$→w ← →w - α∇_→wE(→w) = →w - α(→x^T→w-t)→x.$$

~~~
<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Dataset ($⇉X ∈ ℝ^{N×D}$, $→t ∈ ℝ^N$), learning rate $α ∈ ℝ^+$.<br>
**Output**: Weights $→w ∈ ℝ^D$ which hopefully minimize MSE of linear regression.

- $→w ← 0$
- for $i = 1, \ldots, n$:
  - $→w ← →w - α(→x_i^T→w-t_i)→x_i.$
</div>

section: Classification
# Binary Classification

Binary classification is a classification in two classes.

~~~
To extend linear regression to binary classification, we might seek
a _threshold_ and the classify an input as negative/positive
depending whether $→x^T→w$ is smaller/larger than a given threshold.

~~~
The specific threshold value does not really matter, because the
_bias_ parameter acts as a trainable threshold anyway.

---
# Perceptron

The perceptron algorithm is probably the oldest one for training
weights of a binary classification. It can be proven that it finds
weights $→w$ classifying training set with 100% accuracy if such
weights exist. Such a dataset is called _linearly separable_.

~~~
<div class="algorithm">

**Input**: Linearly separable dataset ($⇉X ∈ ℝ^{N×D}$, $→t ∈ \{-1, +1\}$).<br>
**Output**: Weights $→w ∈ ℝ^D$ such that $t_i →x_i^T→w > 0$ for all $i$.

- $→w ← 0$
- until all examples are classified correctly, process example $i$:
  - $y ← →w^T→x_i$
  - if $t_i y < 0$ (incorrectly classified example):
    - $→w ← →w + t_i →x_i$
</div>

# Logistic Regression

Extends perceptron by
- allowing more than two classes
~~~
- producing full probability distribution.

~~~
For binary case, it employs a formula
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(C_1 | →x) &= σ(→x^t →w + →b) \\
  P(C_0 | →x) &= 1 - P(C_1 | →x),
\end{aligned}$$
where $σ$ is a _sigmoid function_
$$σ(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}.$$

~~~
Can be trained using an SGD algorithm.

# Random Variables
A random variable $⁇x$ is a result of a random process. It can be discrete or
continuous.

~~~
## Probability Distribution
A probability distribution describes how likely are individual values a random
variable can take.

The notation $⁇x ∼ P$ stands for a random variable $⁇x$ having a distribution $P$.

~~~
For discrete variables, the probability that $⁇x$ takes a value $x$ is denoted as
$P(x)$ or explicitly as $P(⁇x = x)$.

~~~
For continuous variables, the probability that the value of $⁇x$ lies in the interval
$[a, b]$ is given by $∫_a^b p(x)\d x$.

---
# Random Variables

## Expectation
The expectation of a function $f(x)$ with respect to discrete probability
distribution $P(x)$ is defined as:
$$𝔼_{⁇x ∼ P}[f(x)] ≝ ∑_x P(x)f(x)$$

For continuous variables it is computed as:
$$𝔼_{⁇x ∼ p}[f(x)] ≝ ∫_x p(x)f(x)\d x$$

~~~
If the random variable is obvious from context, we can write only $𝔼_P[x]$
of even $𝔼[x]$.

~~~
Expectation is linear, i.e.,
$$𝔼_⁇x [αf(x) + βg(x)] = α𝔼_⁇x [f(x)] + β𝔼_⁇x [g(x)]$$

---
# Random Variables

## Variance
Variance measures how much the values of a random variable differ from its
mean $μ = 𝔼[x]$.

$$\begin{aligned}
  \Var(x) &≝ 𝔼\left[\big(x - 𝔼[x]\big)^2\right]\textrm{, or more generally} \\
  \Var(f(x)) &≝ 𝔼\left[\big(f(x) - 𝔼[f(x)]\big)^2\right]
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
It is easy to see that
$$\Var(x) = 𝔼\left[x^2 - 2x𝔼[x] + \big(𝔼[x]\big)^2\right] = 𝔼\left[x^2\right] - \big(𝔼[x]\big)^2.$$

~~~
Variance is connected to $E[x^2]$, a _second moment_ of a random
variable – it is in fact a _centered_ second moment.

---
# Common Probability Distributions
## Bernoulli Distribution
The Bernoulli distribution is a distribution over a binary random variable.
It has a single parameter $φ ∈ [0, 1]$, which specifies the probability of the random
variable being equal to 1.

~~~
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(x) &= φ^x (1-φ)^{1-x} \\
  𝔼[x] &= φ \\
  \Var(x) &= φ(1-φ)
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
## Categorical Distribution
Extension of the Bernoulli distribution to random variables taking one of $k$ different
discrete outcomes. It is parametrized by $→p ∈ [0, 1]^k$ such that $∑_{i=1}^{k} p_{i} = 1$.
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(→x) &= ∏\nolimits_i^k p_i^{x_i} \\
  𝔼[x_i] &= p_i, \Var(x_i) = p_i(1-p_i) \\
\end{aligned}$$

# Information Theory

## Self Information

Amount of _surprise_ when a random variable is sampled.
~~~
- Should be zero for events with probability 1.
~~~
- Less likely events are more surprising.
~~~
- Independent events should have _additive_ information.

~~~
$$I(x) ≝ -\log P(x) = \log \frac{1}{P(x)}$$

~~~
## Entropy

Amount of _surprise_ in the whole distribution.
$$H(P) ≝ 𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[I(x)] = -𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[\log P(x)]$$

~~~
- for discrete $P$: $H(P) = -∑_x P(x) \log P(x)$
- for continuous $P$: $H(P) = -∫ P(x) \log P(x)\,\mathrm dx$

---
# Information Theory

## Cross-Entropy

$$H(P, Q) ≝ -𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[\log Q(x)]$$

~~~
- Gibbs inequality
    - $H(P, Q) ≥ H(P)$
    - $H(P) = H(P, Q) ⇔ P = Q$
~~~
    - Proof: Using Jensen's inequality, we get
      $$∑_x P(x) \log \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} ≤ \log ∑_x P(x) \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} = \log ∑_x Q(x) = 0.$$
~~~
    - Corollary: For a categorical distribution with $n$ outcomes, $H(P) ≤ \log n$,
    because for $Q(x) = 1/n$ we get $H(P) ≤ H(P, Q) = -∑_x P(x) \log Q(x) = \log n.$
~~~
- generally $H(P, Q) ≠ H(Q, P)$

---
# Information Theory

## Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)

Sometimes also called _relative entropy_.

$$D_\textrm{KL}(P || Q) ≝ H(P, Q) - H(P) = 𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[\log P(x) - \log Q(x)]$$

~~~
- consequence of Gibbs inequality: $D_\textrm{KL}(P || Q) ≥ 0$
- generally $D_\textrm{KL}(P || Q) ≠ D_\textrm{KL}(Q || P)$

# Common Probability Distributions
## Normal (or Gaussian) Distribution
Distribution over real numbers, parametrized by a mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$:
$$𝓝(x; μ, σ^2) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2πσ^2}} \exp \left(-\frac{(x - μ)^2}{2σ^2}\right)$$

For standard values $μ=0$ and $σ^2=1$ we get $𝓝(x; 0, 1) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2π}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$.

# Why Normal Distribution

## Central Limit Theorem
The sum of independent identically distributed random variables
with finite variance converges to normal distribution.

~~~
## Principle of Maximum Entropy
Given a set of constraints, a distribution with maximal entropy fulfilling the
constraints can be considered the most general one, containing as little
additional assumptions as possible.

~~~
Considering distributions with a given mean and variance, it can be proven
(using variational inference) that such a distribution with _maximal entropy_
is exactly the normal distribution.
